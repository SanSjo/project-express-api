# Express API Project

In this project I created an API in node Express using different RESTful endpoints that returns an array of data and single items.

## The problem

I had problems with my query that was ignored and didn't print out the single result I wanted. I found out with some help that I had to include my query in the data, so I added the array method .include() to make it work.

I also used other array methods such as .filter() in order to filter the items from the data.

If I had more time I would have worked more on the frontend and would have build a pagination to the page.
